# Hacker News but built with GOV.UK Design System

A Hacker News clone built with the UI library used for any UK government websites.

GOV.UK Design System provides a set of guidelines (Design Pattern, UI components, Styles) to ensure related services are staying consistent with GOV.UK.

Though this site is not related to them in any given points, the motivation behind the adoption is due to my appreciation for its practical user experiences.

## Tech highlights
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (An awesome React framework for rapidly creating React applications without headaches)
- Hacker News API (Hacker News provides an API for fetching their data)
- React Hook
- [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
