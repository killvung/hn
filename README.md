# Hacker News But Built With GOV.UK Design System

A Hacker News clone built with the UI library used for [UK government website](https://www.gov.uk/). 

The system provides sets of guidelines and principles to ensure their services are staying consistent with GOV.UK. Though my site is not related to them in any given points, the motivation behind the adoption is due to my long time appreciation for its practical user experiences, therefore I want to use their ui components and styles to implement the application just for the sake of experience.

## Issues
Still a lot to fix, feel free to [submit](https://github.com/killvung/hn-govuk/issues) them

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
